This is a chess opening trainer, which as of now supports 4 openings with each 5 lines.

After the openings are completed, stockfish takes over and plays against you at an elo of about 1300. 

For Stockfish to work tho, you need to insert the path to your own stockfish binary on your computer in the main.py file.
